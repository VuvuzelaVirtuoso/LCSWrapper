# kolmafia-LCSWrapper

KoL Script to handle a softcore Community Service ascension as a mysticallity class. This script is medium shiny, with a few higher-end IOTMs supported! Contrary to the name, **this is not a wrapper, and will only complete the community service path and nothing else.**

## Installation:

To install, paste the following into the CGLI:

`git checkout https://github.com/jimmyking9999999/LCSWrapper.git main`

To run, simply type `lcswrapper` into the CGLI.


## Required IoTMs:
[Neverending party invitation envelope](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Neverending_Party_invitation_envelope) - Powerleveling scaling zone, with plenty of good drops!

[Combat Lover's Locket Lockbox](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Combat_lover%27s_locket_lockbox) - Access to 300% weapon damage, 50% item, a source of extra turngen, and 200% spell damage!

[Packaged Jurassic Parka](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_Jurassic_Parka) - Free YR, Early 20% mainstat exp bonus, massively helps survivability.

[Packaged Model Train Set](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_model_train_set) - Very, very strong for early leveling. Helps with meat, and also saves a turn for the hot res test.

[Kramco Industries Packing Carton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Kramco_Industries_packing_carton) - Scaling wanderer, trivializes MP issues and provides turngen after coiling some wires

[Clan VIP Lounge Invitation](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_invitation) - Many, many buffs

[Packaged Backup Camera*](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_backup_camera) - 11 additional scaling fights.

*With enough leveling IotMs, this may be skipped

Note that these are the script's hard requirements. If you only have said seven iotms, there will simply be too little turngen/turncut to complete the entire CS ascension. 

## Other requirements:
Your locket should have the following monsters in it: 

[Red Skeleton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Red_skeleton) - 100% weapon damage drop

[Witchess Bishop](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_Bishop) - 50% item EPIC booze, gives extra turngen when needed

[Ungulith](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ungulith) - 200% weapon and spell damage. 


A fully suited out VIP clan - You can set this clan by typing `lcswrapper help` in the GCLI.
If you do not have a [Fourth of May Cosplay Saber](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Fourth_of_May_Cosplay_Saber) and an [Industrial Fire Extinguisher](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_industrial_fire_extinguisher), you'll need a Faxbot whitelisted into your clan, for a [Factory Worker](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Factory_worker_\(female\)) fax.


[Saucegeyser](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Saucegeyser), [Curse of Weaksauce](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Curse_of_Weaksauce), and [Itchy Curse Finger](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Itchy_Curse_Finger) permed. This trivializes most combat encounters we'll be facing, the latter two helping to regulate surviability and MP usage. If you have a saber and a fire extinguisher, you'll want [Double-Fisted Skull Smashing](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Double-Fisted_Skull_Smashing) permed as well. 

A [Calzone of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Calzone_of_Legend) in your inventory when you ascend - The 300% myst buff is invaluable to our powerleveling needs.

## Ascending into CS:

This script only works for myst classes at the current moment, both softcore and hardcore. Most moon signs should be fine.
However, If you have a [rune-strewn spoon cocoon](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Rune-strewn_spoon_cocoon), ascending Wallaby is best as we'll be able to get cheap beach access for [baconstoned](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Baconstoned).

An [astral six-pack](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pilsner) is required due to the much larger turngen, and will be used as the primary source of adventures in the run. All astral pets are fine, but an [astral pet sweater](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pet_sweater) is preferred, for an extra 1-2 turns saved.
If you have a comma chameleon or choose to value the karma over the turns, you may run the script without a pet.

A [Calzone of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Calzone_of_Legend) in Hagnk's, if you're ascending softcore. The script will continue without it, but you will lose the turngen and spell damage. If you have a [Cookbookbat](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Cookbookbat) and cannot cap the item test, you should have the [roasted vegetable of Jarlsberg](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Roasted_vegetable_of_Jarlsberg) recipe unlocked. 

## IoTM Support:

My [snapshot](https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=Jimmyking) includes most perms and skills that are supported. Additional IoTMs that are supported include the following IoTM functionalities. Stat-stick shinies such as the Guzzlr application will always be included, as the script uses the mafia maximizer for equipment stats:

- Boxing Day care package
- Distant Woods Getaway Brochure
- Beach Comb Box
- mint-in-box Powerful Glove
- God Lobster Egg
- pantogram
- X-32-F snowman crate
- Chateau Mantegna room key*
- Tome of Clip Art
- Apathargic Bandersnatch

\* Due to the introduction of the Cincho de Mayo, this IoTM is no longer fully used.

## Additional Information:

When first starting the script, you will be prompted to run the `help` option in the popup. This will prompt you to set certain settings within the script, allowing for flexibility. 

In the menu, you will be asked for your minimum turncount for tests. It is a good idea to set everything to 1, and manually buff up what the script does not for your tests. This will fine tune your minimum turncount, so that you may optimize your CS loops. 



Happy Looping!
