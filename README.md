# kolmafia-LCSWrapper

KoL Script to handle a softcore Community Service ascension as a sauceror. This script is medium shiny!

## Installation:

To install, paste the following into the CGLI:

`git checkout https://github.com/jimmyking9999999/LCSWrapper.git main`

To run, simply type `lcswrapper` into the CGLI.


## Required IoTMs:
[Neverending party invitation envelope](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Neverending_Party_invitation_envelope) - Powerleveling scaling zone, with plenty of good drops!

[Combat Lover's Locket Lockbox](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Combat_lover%27s_locket_lockbox) - Access to 300% weapon damage, 50% item, a source of extra turngen, and 200% spell damage!

[Packaged Jurassic Parka](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_Jurassic_Parka) - Free YR, Early 20% mainstat exp bonus, massively helps survivability.

[Packaged Model Train Set](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_model_train_set) - Very, very strong for early leveling. Helps with meat, and also saves a turn for the hot res test.

[Kramco Industries Packing Carton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Kramco_Industries_packing_carton) - Scaling wanderer, trivializes MP issues and provides turngen after coiling some wires

[Clan VIP Lounge Invitation](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_invitation) - Many, many buffs

[Packaged Backup Camera*](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_backup_camera) - 11 additional scaling fights.

*With enough leveling IotMs, this may be skipped

Note that these are the script's hard requirements. If you only have said seven iotms, there will simply be too little turngen/turncut to complete the entire CS ascension. 

## Other requirements:
Your locket should have the following monsters in it: 
[Red Skeleton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Red_skeleton) - 100% weapon damage drop
[Witchess Bishop](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_Bishop) - 50% item EPIC booze, gives extra turngen when needed
[Ungulith](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ungulith) - 200% weapon and spell damage. 

A fully suited out VIP clan - You can set this clan by typing `lcswrapper help` in the GCLI.
If you do not have a [Fourth of May Cosplay Saber](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Fourth_of_May_Cosplay_Saber) and an [Industrial Fire Extinguisher](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Packaged_industrial_fire_extinguisher), you'll need a Faxbot whitelisted into your clan, for a [Factory Worker](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Factory_worker_\(female\)) fax.

[Saucegeyser](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Saucegeyser), [Curse of Weaksauce](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Curse_of_Weaksauce), and [Itchy Curse Finger](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Itchy_Curse_Finger) - This trivializes most combat encounters we'll be facing, the latter two helping to regulate surviability and MP usage.

A [Calzone of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Calzone_of_Legend) in your inventory when you ascend - The 300% myst buff is invaluable to our powerleveling needs.

## Ascending into CS:

This script only works for saucerors at the current moment, and hardcore is not supported. Most moon signs should be fine - If you have a [rune-strewn spoon cocoon](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Rune-strewn_spoon_cocoon), ascending Sauceror/Wallaby is best, as we'll be able to get early beach access for [baconstoned](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Baconstoned) for easier powerleveling. An [astral six-pack](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pilsner) is preferred, due to the much larger turngen, and will be used as the primary source of adventures in the run. Most pets are fine, but an [astral pet sweater](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pet_sweater) is preferred.
